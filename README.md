# Little Shop of Whiskey
Project description: This project was our second deployed Rails app from our second Module at Turing School of Software & Design. The goal of our website was to create a working shop where users can register, create orders, browse wares, or become merchants. Our focus was on logical namespacing as well as dividing up tasks among the Models, Views, and Controllers.

Project is deployed at: https://gentle-lowlands-85048.herokuapp.com
